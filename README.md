# This is a refractor of the Horiseon website to follow accessibility standards.

The purpose of this project is to update the Horiseon website to both follow accessibility standards and to update the code where necessary to make it run more efficiently. HTML and CSS were used to accomplish this update. The code used only div tags so all of them had to be updated for accessability. The CSS file also had extensive sepearation of class elements that were consolidated to make things run more efficently. The following were done:

1. Head Title changed
2. Semantics used: header, footer, hero, section, and article used where appropriate and updated in CSS as necessary.
3. CSS elements were moved around into sections for readability
4. Name clickable and links corrected
5. Add alt text to 6 images on the website, but the background image in CSS was left as is since it is generally accepted and not possible to add alt text to it. 
6. Cleaned up indentation and a few html areas that could be consolidated.  
7. Collapsed CSS sections as necessary
